# Project-Specific Tag Property Rules
#
# This file defines YOUR project's custom tag requirements.
# Rules here must be PROGRAMMATICALLY VERIFIABLE by the janitor (a deterministic linter).
#
# The janitor validates:
# - Required frontmatter properties exist
# - Link restrictions are enforced
# - Property values match expected patterns (regex)
#
# It does NOT validate:
# - Semantic correctness (e.g., "is this tutorial well-written?")
# - Content quality
# - Human judgment calls

# Entry Point Tag - Main entry points to documentation/codebase
entry-point:
  tag: "type/entry-point"
  description: "Main entry points that users start from (README, getting-started, etc.)"

  required_properties:
    - audience       # Must exist (string value)

  link_restrictions:
    # Entry points can ONLY be linked from these tag types
    allowed_inbound_tags:
      - "type/entry-point"      # Other entry points
      - "type/index"            # Index/map files

    # Entry points can link to anything
    allowed_outbound_tags: "*"

  enforcement: "error"

# ============================================================================
# Add your own custom tags below!
# ============================================================================
#
# Programmatically verifiable rules:
# - required_properties: Property name must exist in frontmatter
# - link_restrictions: Linking file must have one of the allowed tags
# - property_pattern: Property value must match regex (optional)
#
# Example:
#
# my-tag:
#   tag: "type/my-type"
#   required_properties:
#     - status              # Must have 'status' property
#   property_patterns:      # Optional: validate property values
#     status: "^(draft|published|archived)$"  # Must be one of these
#   link_restrictions:
#     allowed_inbound_tags:
#       - "type/index"
#   enforcement: "error"
