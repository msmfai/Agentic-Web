# User Input Validation

Input validation ensures that data provided by users is correct, safe, and usable before processing.

## Key Principles

- **Range validation**: Check if numbers are within acceptable ranges
- **Error handling**: Provide meaningful error messages
- **Sanitization**: Clean input data to prevent issues

## Validation Rules for Calculator

- Division by zero must be prevented
- Operations must be from the allowed set
