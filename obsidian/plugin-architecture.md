# Plugin Architecture

A **plugin architecture** is a design pattern that enables extensibility by allowing third-party or modular components to be loaded dynamically at runtime without modifying the core application.

## Core Concepts

### Plugin Lifecycle

Plugins go through several lifecycle states:

1. **Discovery** - Finding available plugins in the filesystem
2. **Loading** - Reading plugin code and creating instances
3. **Registration** - Adding plugin operations to the registry
4. **Execution** - Running plugin functionality
5. **Unloading** - Removing plugin from memory
6. **Reloading** - Hot-swapping updated plugin code

### Hot Reloading

**Hot reloading** allows plugins to be updated without restarting the application. This is achieved by:

- Tracking loaded modules in `sys.modules`
- Removing old module references on unload
- Re-importing updated code on reload
- Notifying observers when plugins change

## Benefits

- **Extensibility** - Add features without modifying core code
- **Modularity** - Plugins are self-contained units
- **Dynamic behavior** - Enable/disable features at runtime
- **Third-party integration** - Allow external developers to extend functionality
- **Testing** - Test plugins independently

## Implementation Details

### Plugin Contract

Each plugin must export a `PLUGIN_OPERATIONS` dictionary mapping operation names to callable functions:

```python
PLUGIN_OPERATIONS = {
    'mean': calculate_mean,
    'median': calculate_median,
    'mode': calculate_mode,
}
```

### Observer Pattern Integration

The plugin system uses the [[single-responsibility#Observer Pattern|Observer Pattern]] to notify interested parties when plugins are loaded, unloaded, or changed:

- Observers register callbacks via `register_observer()`
- Plugin system notifies observers on state changes
- Observers can update UI, clear caches, or log events

### Dependency Injection

Plugins are **injected** into the calculator at runtime rather than being hard-coded dependencies. This follows the [[single-responsibility#Dependency Injection|Dependency Injection]] principle.

## Related Patterns

- [[strategy-pattern|Strategy Pattern]] - Plugins implement different strategies for operations
- [[single-responsibility|Single Responsibility Principle]] - Each plugin handles one domain

## Implementation

- Core: [[code/plugin_system.py|Plugin System]]
- Integration: [[code/calculator.py|Calculator Class]]

## Example Plugins

- [[code/plugins/statistics.py|Statistics Plugin]] - Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- [[code/plugins/finance.py|Finance Plugin]] - Compound interest, NPV, amortization
- [[code/plugins/linear_algebra.py|Linear Algebra Plugin]] - Vector operations, dot product
- [[code/plugins/units.py|Unit Conversion Plugin]] - Length, weight, temperature conversions

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- Extremely flexible and extensible
- Plugins can be developed independently
- No recompilation needed for new features

**Cons:**

- More complex than static imports
- Runtime overhead for module loading
- Plugin errors can crash the application
- Versioning and compatibility challenges
